          >If you plan on serving these right away, preheat the oven to 325

          Steps:
          <li>
            Place cubed potatoes in a large part of lightly salted water. Bring
            to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender, usually about 15-20
            mins; drain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer potatoes into a large bowl and mash. Stir in heavy cream,
            milk, cheese, butter, salt, and pepper until well combined. Transfer
            into a large casserole dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let potatoes cool completely, 15-20 minutes. Cover with aluminum
            foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days. >
          </li>
          <li>
            When ready to bake, remove casserole from the refrigerator and let
            sit for 30 minutes on the counter. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F
            (165 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 50 minutes.</li>
