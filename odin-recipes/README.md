Foundations Recipes Practice

//write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

## My goal for this project was to use a standard HTML boilerplate to build a recipe landing page, using the following setup from the Odin Project.

- Project Link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

## How to navigate this project

- Simple Landing page with 3 links
- Each link contains a simple styled h1, img, h3, ul, li, ol, li

## Why I built the project this way

- Purely followed the directions here!

## If I had more time I would change this

- this definitely lacks the amount of style / flair I would add to a page, given the time / opportunity. But, I understand the reason for the process -- learn to wrap your head around html and basics of css without falling down the rabbit hole üê∞
